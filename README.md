## Explanation of Code:
## Text Preprocessing: The preprocess_text function handles tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, and sentiment word extraction using the SentiWordNet lexicon.
## RoBERTa Word Embedding: We use the RoBERTa model to transform the reviews into high-dimensional embeddings.
## BiGRU Model with Attention: A BiGRU layer with an attention mechanism is used to capture important sequential features. The output layer uses a sigmoid function for binary classification (positive or negative).
## PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
## could you please give me the output in plot or chart form for the above code
## To generate the output as a plot or chart, we can use the PCA visualization to show the reduced-dimensionality results of the movie reviews. The plot will display the two principal components from the PCA, colored based on the sentiment labels (0 for Negative, 1 for Positive).
## Hereâ€™s how the code visualizes the PCA result, including a scatter plot with the sentiment labels:
## PCA Visualization: After applying PCA for dimensionality reduction to 2 components, we plot the results on a scatter plot. The points will be colored according to their sentiment (0: Negative, 1: Positive).
## Accuracy Plot: The model's training and validation accuracy can also be plotted to visualize how well the model performs over epochs.
## How to Generate the Plot
## The matplotlib library can be used for visualization. Below is the relevant part of the code that shows the PCA visualization. This code will plot the PCA results, and we will also plot training vs validation accuracy for the model.
